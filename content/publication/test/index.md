  We study the effect of Markov moves on L²-Burau maps of braids, in order to
  construct link invariants from these maps with a process mirroring the
  well-known Alexander-Burau formula.


  We prove such a Markov invariance for L²-Burau maps going to the groups of the braid closures or deeper.  In the case of the link group, the corresponding link invariant was known to be the L²-Alexander torsion by a previous result of A. Conway and the author. 


  Furthermore, we find two counter-examples,  meaning two families of L²-Burau maps that cannot yield link invariants in this way.  The proofs use relations between Fuglede-Kadison determinants, Mahler measures, and random walks on Cayley graphs, and the works of Boyd, Bartholdi and Dasbach-Lalin. 


  All  of  this  suggests  that  twisted L²-Alexander  torsions  are  the  only  link invariants we can hope to construct from L²-Burau maps with such a process.
